## Installing Ansible

**Ansible**'s only real dependency is Python. Once Python is installed, the simplest way to get Ansible running is to use `pip`.

```
pip install ansible
```

> You must enable SSH remote connection on your Synology NAS before running Ansible commands. You can follow the steps in this article:

## Creating a basic inventory file

Ansible uses an inventory file (basically, a list of servers) to communicate with your servers. Create a file `hosts` in your project root folder and add one server to it:

```yml
[wifi]
192.0.2.5
```

The `wifi` is an arbitrary name for the group of servers you're managing, followed by the IP addresses of your servers, one per line. If you're not using port 22 for SSH, you will need to append it to the address.

## Running your first Ad-Hoc Ansible command

Now that you've installed Ansible and created an inventory file, it's time to run a command:

```sh
ansible <group> -i ./hosts -m ping -u <user>
```

Ansible assumes you're using a passwordless login for SSH (e.g. you login by entering `ssh <user>@<serverip>`). If you're using a password, add the `-k` flag to Ansible commands (you may need to install the `sshpass` package for this to work).

You can associate a `<user>` with each IP address, thus making your Ansible commands shorter.

```yml
[wifi]
192.0.2.5 ansible_user=admin
```

Alternatively, you can place the `ansible_user` variable under a group `<group>:vars`, which then applies the variables to all servers in that group.

```yml
[wifi]
192.0.2.5

[wifi:vars]
ansible_user=admin
```

The previous command would now be:

```sh
ansible <group> -i ./hosts -m ping
```

## Your first Ansible playbook

Create a folder `plays/` and add a file `check-linux-system-playbook.yml` in that folder. Copy and paste the following code:

```yml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Ensure NTP is running
    service: name=ntpd state=started
```

Now that you've created your first Ansible playbook, it is time to run it.

```sh
ansible-playbook -i ./hosts plays/check-linux-system-playbook.yml
```

## Troubleshooting

### Using SSH connection type with passwords

If you get this error when using option ` -k` to ask for connection password, you must install the sshpass program.

```sh
<SERVER_IP> | FAILED! => {
    "msg": "to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords, you must install the sshpass program"
}
```

> There are instructions on how to install **sshpass** here:
> 
> https://gist.github.com/arunoda/7790979

For macOS, you will need to install **Xcode** and command line tools then use the unofficial Homebrew command:

```sh
brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass
```

### Too many authentication failure

If you get the following SSH Error:

```sh
$ Received disconnect from host: 2: Too many authentication failures
```

This could happen if you have five or more DSA/RSA identity files stored in your .ssh directory. In this case if the -i option isn't specified at the command line the ssh client will first attempt to login using each identity (private key) and next prompt for password authentication. However, sshd drops the connection after five bad login attempts (again default may vary).

So if you have a number of private keys in your .ssh directory you could disable Public Key Authentication at the command line using the -o optional argument.

```sh
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <user>@<serverip>
```

### You are still asked by SSH to enter a password

SSH to your server and change the following permissions:

```sh
chmod 755 $HOME
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Missing sudo password 

If you get the following error:

```sh
fatal: [192.168.86.32]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Missing sudo password"}
```

Connect to your Synology NAS via SSH and then become a superuser `sudo su -`. Enter your `root` password which should be the same as your `admin` password.

Create a file `/etc/sudoers.d/admin` and add the following line: 

```
admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

You have enabled superuser for your Ansible commands.
